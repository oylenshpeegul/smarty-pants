# smarty-pants

Source code for [smarty pants](https://oylenshpeegul.github.io/smarty-pants/) calculator.

Written in Elm. Website requires

* index.html
* style.css
* public.js

The first two are static. To generate `public.js` from `smarty_pants.elm`, run `make`. This assumes you have [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and [elm-make](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html#elm-make).

Thanks to [@kelonye](https://github.com/kelonye) for making [demo-bmi-calc](https://github.com/kelonye/demo-bmi-calc), from which much of this was copied.
